Visualizing Garbage Collection Algorithms
By Ken Fox | Published: September 3, 2014
Most developers take automatic garbage collection for granted. It’s just another amazing feature provided by our language run-times to make our jobs easier.

But if you try to peek inside a modern garbage collector, it’s very difficult to see how they actually work. There are thousands of implementation details that will confuse you unless you already have a good understanding of what it’s trying to do and how they can go fantastically wrong.

I’ve built a toy with five different garbage collection algorithms. Small animations were created from the run-time behavior. You can find larger animations and the code to create them at github.com/kenfox/gc-viz. It surprised me how much a simple animation reveals about these important algorithms.
